                        <p>
                            In this document we explain the installation process for an experimental bot prototype for
                            the game
                            RuneEscape (old version) using Python in Windows. The bot has very limited capabilities for
                            now but we
                            want to share
                            the work that has been begun by Sebastian Urrejola in his spare time.
                            I asked him for this content because it would be useful for creating this technical
                            documentation page
                            with original content for my web development certificate in <a
                                href=”https://www.freecodecamp.org/ target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>.

                            <li>
                                It’s of most importance to clarify that the production of this bot is for educational
                                use only and we
                                condemn any kind of illicit activities that goes against the game rules. Nevertheless,
                                how this
                                information is going to be used will be the responsibility of each individual user.

                            <li>
                                Before we start we will assume that you already know how to download the game and have
                                the minimum
                                understanding of how it works and what the goals are. The client we prefer and use is
                                the one you can
                                find on <a href=”https://runelite.net/ target="_blank"> runelite.</a>

                                Detection: The goal of the bot is to detect movement in the game, by looking for change
                                in pixels on the
                                game window. To do this, it takes 2 consecutive screenshots of the game so it can
                                compare them looking
                                for the regions with differences, then the bot moves the cursor to the center of the
                                bigger region with
                                differences and clicks***.
                            </li>
                            <li>HP Measure: The bot takes a screenshot of the region where the HP indicator is located
                                in the game.
                                (top left side of the minimap). Then the bot takes the RGB information of a section of
                                the screenshot,
                                counting the amount of red pixels that passes a certain threshold, so it counts the
                                amount of pixels in
                                the game that indicate the amount of HP the user has.

                        <p>First we need to put the runescape window in a reproducible position, i.e., a place where you
                            can place
                            the
                            window and it will always have the same position.</p>
                        <p>We recommend you drag the window to the right side of the screen, so it divides the screen in
                            2 sections.
                            The left one with the code, and the right one with the game. Something like this</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/seburrejola/TruchoBot_v0/blob/master/TruchoBot_v0/console_rune.png?raw=true"
                            alt="Screen Split of console and game" class="splitimg">
                        <p>On the top left side of the map in the game, you can see an HP indicator**, we need to get
                            its location
                            and size. You could get this info with various methods, a simple method could be taking a
                            screenshot, then
                            opening it on paint and measuring the size ( width , height ) of the HP indicator, like this
                            <br><img
                                src="https://github.com/seburrejola/TruchoBot_v0/blob/master/TruchoBot_v0/heart_size.jpg?raw=true"
                                alt="HP Health Hearth icon">.
                        </p>
                        <p>With the size of the indicator you can now work on the location, by placing your cursos near
                            the top left
                            pixel of the HP indicator you should get an approximate location of the indicator (the pixel
                            coordinates
                            should appear in the bottom of the paint window).
                        </p>
                        <p>After getting this numbers, let’s call them ( x_aprox , y_aprox ), you will need to run this
                            line of code
                            in the IDLE terminal:
                        </p>
                        <code>import pyautogui</code>
                        <code>pyautogui.screenshot(region=( x_aprox , y_aprox , width , height ) ).show() </code>
                        <p>Is important to note that the width and the height should be the same number. Running the
                            above line will
                            open a window with a screenshot, the screenshot top left coordinates are ( x_aprox , y_aprox
                            ), with a
                            size ( width , height ). </p>
                        <p>Now you have to change the “x” and “y” coordinates in order to get a square with the HP
                            indicator, like
                            this:</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/seburrejola/TruchoBot_v0/blob/master/TruchoBot_v0/corzaronrune.jpg?raw=true"
                            alt="RuneScape Ingame HP Icon">
                        <p>When you achieve it, you need to set up the pixels lines in where the HP_detection.py will
                            check. To do
                            this, you will need to save the screenshot you took with the python IDLE with this command:
                        </p>
                        <code>pyautogui.screenshot(region=( x_topleft , y_topleft , width , height ) ).save(“file_name.jpg”)</code>
                        <p>Then, open that file with paint and get the locations of these lines (white_green_lines.jpg),
                            from this
                            you need the size of the white and green lines.
                        </p>
                        <p>The info you collected should be something like this:</p>
                        <div class="notcode">
                            Top_white_line = 1x6 → from here you need the height, in this case 6pixels
                            Mid_white_line = 1x20 → from here you need the height, in this case 20pixels
                            #Bot_white_line = 1x6

                            Top_green_line = 16x1 → from here you need the width, in this case 16pixels
                            Mid_green_line = 6x1 → from here you need the width, in this case 6pixels
                            #Bot_green_line = 16x1
                        </div>
                        <p>After getting this info, you will need to change these lines of code in HP_detection.py :</p>
                        <code>
                         def main_HP():
<span style="margin-left:3em">x_ss = 1735 - 91 	→  your x_topleft</span> 
	<span style="margin-left:3em">y_ss = 82 + 21 	→  your y_topleft</span> 
	<span style="margin-left:3em">w_ss = 33 		→  your width </span>
	<span style="margin-left:3em">h_ss = 33		→  your height </span>
	<span style="margin-left:3em">coord_img = [ ]</span>
<span style="margin-left:3em">top_white_line = 6   	→ your number</span>
	<span style="margin-left:3em">mid_white_line = 20    → your number</span>
	<span style="margin-left:3em">top_green_line = 16    → your number</span>
 <span style="margin-left:3em">mid_green_line = 6     → your number</span>
                       

                        </code>
                        <p>After this, the HP_detection.py should work well, then you need to change one more thing, but
                            now in the
                            main_bot.py code.</p>
                        <p>Using the IDLE console you opened earlier, run the line</p>
                        <code>pyautogui.getAllTitles()</code>
                        <p>This will return a list with all the titles of the windows you have running. Search on this
                            list for the
                            one that corresponds to your runescape window, in my cases it is “Old School RuneScape”
                        </p>
                        <p>After you get the title, go to the code named main_bot.py, open it with IDLE, go to the line
                            21, and and
                            change it to what you obtained in the previous step, something like this:</p>
                        <code>win_index = pyautogui.getAllTitles().index(“TITLE OF YOUR RUNESCAPE WINDOW”')</code>
                        <p>Once you have done all this hard work, the code should be ready to run.S</p>
